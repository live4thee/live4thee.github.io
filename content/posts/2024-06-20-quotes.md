[HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40726641) 上看见一则陶哲轩的
帖子：[There's more to mathematics than rigour and proofs (2007)](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/)

文章开头引用的是 [Douglas Adams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams)
在《银河系漫游指南》中的句子：

> The history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass
> through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival,
> Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why, and
> Where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the
> question ‘How can we eat?’, the second by the question ‘Why do we
> eat?’ and the third by the question, ‘Where shall we have lunch?’
>
>  -- Douglas Adams, [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)
