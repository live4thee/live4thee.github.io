前几天看到一篇文章，[如何处理负面反馈](https://www.getflack.com/p/responding-to-negative-feedback),
非常赞同。全文摘录 TL;DR 如下：

1. **Separate the information part from the emotion part.** There’s the
substance of the feedback, and there’s the customer’s frustration and
expectation of being heard. Those are discrete, and you can’t address the
former without resolving the latter.

2. **Start by aligning on principles, before rushing to defend yourself.**
Whatever the merits of the feedback, you agree that quality is important,
that feedback is valuable, and that the feedback has found the person who’s
responsible. Again, there’s no hope of aligning on facts if you can’t
first align on principles.

3. Make a point of overindexing on **accountability**. Take more responsibility
than what seems necessary. Take so much ownership that it surprises
people. This obviates their need to hector you over it and removes a lot
of surface area for attack, creating space for a calmer exchange. More
importantly, if you’re the founder, the reality is that every detail of
your product does fall on you.

4. If you need to clarify facts, **explain instead of defending**. You can share
the exact same information in a way that’s either defensive and caustic,
or earnest and transparent. The only difference is tone.

5. If self-critique or apology is warranted (it isn’t always), **keep it
straightforward**. No need to grovel or self flagellate. Recap the problem
plainly, explain the fix, say what you’re doing to prevent it in the future,
and wrap it up. Then move on.

前段时间买了两本书。一本是很厚的《[重走](https://book.douban.com/subject/35436901/)》
-- 最近一直在B站听这本书，挺不错。买回来就被孩子拿走去看了，貌似还挺喜欢。
里面有很多有意思的人物关系线索。

另外一本是经典《[英文写作指南](https://book.douban.com/subject/2067435/)》，
很薄。刚工作的时候老板非常推荐，让我们看英文原版，和另一本名作《[The Design of Everyday Things](https://book.douban.com/subject/1365318/)》一起作为组内必读。孩子摆在案头，
貌似未曾打开过。
